# Data Science Challenge

A challenge initially completed for the Lighthouse selection process and updated in 2025 to compare my personal development in data science.

## How to Run:

1.  Open the `desafio_data_science.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2.  In the Colab interface, open the "Files" tab on the left sidebar.
3.  Upload the two required CSV files (`wage_train.csv` and `wage_test.csv`) to this main directory. The notebook is configured to read them from the root of the Colab environment (e.g., `/content/wage_train.csv`).
4.  Run the notebook cells in order to see the data analysis, model training, and final results.
