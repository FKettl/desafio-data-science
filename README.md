# Data Science Challenge

A challenge initially completed for the Lighthouse selection process and updated in 2025 to compare my personal development in data science.
The objective of this project is to predict whether an individual earns more than $50K a year based on census data. This is a binary classification task.

## How to Run:

1.  Open the `desafio_data_science.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2.  In the Colab interface, open the "Files" tab on the left sidebar.
3.  Upload the two required CSV files (`wage_train.csv` and `wage_test.csv`) to this main directory. The notebook is configured to read them from the root of the Colab environment (e.g., `/content/wage_train.csv`).
4.  Run the notebook cells in order to see the data analysis, model training, and final results.
